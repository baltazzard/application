In this folder you will find the diagrams that I made according to the requirements and acceptance criteria given to me.

The CI_CD_DeploymentLogic.drawio.png contains file the flow of what will happens after you push a change in the github repo which will then trigger an update in the code in the deployed machines
The High_Availability_Diagram.drawio.png shows file the feature of AutoScaling and High Availability. If a server goes down it will be detected by the LB and will trigger a new one to create. If a machine is rebooted then there is crontab that will trigger at boot to start the application.
The Load_Balancer.drwaio.png file shows the load balancing made to access the application within the HA servers. The Same can be accessed by the following URL http://applicationlbforgl-1835781767.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/login/
